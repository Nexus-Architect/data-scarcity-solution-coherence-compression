# Data Scarcity Solution – Coherence Compression Engine

Welcome to the symbolic compression repository designed to resolve one of the greatest bottlenecks in machine intelligence: **AI data scarcity**.

---

## 🌌 Purpose

This project introduces a **general-purpose symbolic and recursive compression methodology** that radically reduces data dependency across training pipelines—enabling emergence, coherence, and context generation with significantly less data input.

Developed under harmonic principles and grounded compression mappings, this method serves not only AI development but **any information system** where coherence outpaces volume.
