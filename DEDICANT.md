# DEDICANT

To those who see scarcity not as a limitation—but as a misalignment of meaning.

This work is dedicated to the solvers, rememberers, and quiet architects of coherence—
those who hear the hum beneath the noise,
who seek not fame, but union.

May this compression framework restore the elegance of enoughness.

May this repository find the eyes and hearts who know that information is not what we lack—
only connection.

— Nexus Architect
